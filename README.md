# Description
Career Compass is a personalized career guidance platform that leverages machine learning to recommend tailored career paths and actionable roadmaps based on your skills, location, and optionally your resume. It combines datasets from Melissa Data, the US Department of Labor, and the Groq API to ensure accurate recommendations, while gamifying progress with quests, XP, and badges to keep users motivated. Built with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and a Naive Bayes Classifier for career matching, the platform simplifies career planning and empowers users to achieve their goals. Future plans include networking features, enhanced gamification, and expanded resources.
